# Weather-Journal App Project

My name **Reem Montaser**
# The about project
It is talking about the weather in country first we create an account in openweathermap.com to get the private appiKey. We work on **server.js anad app.js files** in our project. In files we Added GET and POST routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server. And the body-parser package should be installed and included in the project.
The Local server should be running to the Command Line through a working callback function.
And we also used **style.css** to make a style in your project.
I advantage of this project that iam learning more about the server file ,It was experience to know how to work on full project with the server .
